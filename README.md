This is a website created as part of an assessment. However, it will continually be updated and used as a portfolio and virtual CV. It will be used by my mentor, as well as recruiters. The website will showcase my skills and abilities, and will eventually allow users to contact me through the contact form. 

## UX
As this website is for recruiters, I have chosen to use light pastel colours to deliver a neutral, visually pleasing aesthetic, to appeal to a broader audience. 

### User Stories
- As a recruiter, I want to see the skills of the developer written out simply. 
- As a recruiter, I want to see the skills and abilities of the developer in practice. 
- As someone in need of a website, I want to be able to contact the developer. 
- As a recruiter, I want to learn more about the person developing the website. 

### Wireframes
I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. Links to the files are below:

- **Examples** of other websites I have built. Once I have built more websites, I will add screenshots to index.html
